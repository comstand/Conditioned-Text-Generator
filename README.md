Directory structure
There is only a single file, conditioned_text_generator.ipynb written by me.

The notebook is split into 4 components,
1. Define global variables, vocabulary, and data
2. Define the model, including the encoder, decoder, discriminator, and generator
3. Define the training module, and train the model
4. Module testing, contains several pre-defined values to use for text generation
